### About Swiss-system tournament

A Swiss-system tournament is a tournament which uses a non-elimination format.
Competitors meet one-to-one in each round and are paired using a predetermined set of rules designed to ensure that as far as possible a competitor plays competitors with the same current score, subject to not playing the
same opponent more than once. The winner is the competitor with the highest aggregate points earned in all rounds.
